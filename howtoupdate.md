# How to update the website

This website is made using a technology called **markdown**.

Here is a [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to how markdown works.

HTML tags can also be used within markdown. Here is a [guide](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php) to html tags.

Everytime you edit **README.md**, you must push the edits to the github repository. The repository will automatically run, and then update the website.

## How to add files to the website

Previously, everything is done using markdown so you can just link to the file within the repository.

```
[file](link_to_the_file.txt)
```

All files must be within the repostiory, and the names cannot have any spaces.

I have already included a link template that is different with the **a** html tag. You can copy and paste this over and over and just edit the name of the file.
